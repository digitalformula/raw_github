# Raw GitHub

Wordpress plugin to accept the URL for a GitHub *raw* file along with a code language.  Using that URL and language, display the contents of the raw file within a Wordpress post and highlight it using Prism.js

Important note: This plugin was developed with a very site-specific use case in mind so probably won't be overly suitable for anyone else.  Please feel free to use as the basis for your own stuff, though.
